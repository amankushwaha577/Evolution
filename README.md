I developed EvolutionNova, a user-friendly Diary Application, as a personal project. This initiative showcased tilizing technologies like React and Tailwind CSS for a modern interface, Node.js and MongoDB for robust backend functionality, and Next.js for enhanced performance. I prioritized user data security with BCrypt.js and ensured a smooth user experience.
